    <!-- To create the loading screen, first a container was made and an image of choice was added and adjusted. Text was also included in the container. 
    JavaScript was then added for example, a function was created to make the loading screen dissapear when the animation process was completed. Get element by ID
  was added to grab the loading screen ID so the JavaScript knows what to display. The time was set to 4 seconds (4000) which is the timer of how long the screen 
is shown for. Animation such as animation-duration, animation-iteration-count and animation-timing-function was added to style the type of animation (ease-in-out) and if
it ends or is infinate. The outcome planned was achieved. This approach was chosen because it was quite simple and effective (completed the idea) and can be applied to
any page as demonstrated. Alternativly, an approach could include embedding the visuals as CSS body images and a setVisible function to  select this and display is as a
block when triggered and use true and false methods so that the code knows when to display: page = true, loading = false (Mr. Polywhirl, 2021) -->

<!-- For the accessible colour theme switcher, it was originally plansed to only change the colour of the text background. Through research and thinking it through,
this was changed so that the entire screen became another colour instead. This was achieved by creating CSS stylesheets for each colour. A link to each of these
was created in the form of a button. Javascript was then added to select all buttons (as all buttons had the same class name) and a click event listener with the change
colour function was added so that when the button is clicked the theme stylesheets (that all have the same ID) are changed to users preference. This was successful and
was also integrated with the hamburger menu code (Elderflower, no date). Alternativly, this can be achieved by only using light and dark mode which only requires a button
with an onclick function and JavaScript that toggles a classList (css) to dark mode.-->
